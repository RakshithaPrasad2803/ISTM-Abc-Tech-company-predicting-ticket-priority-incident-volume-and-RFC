# ISTM-Abc-Tech-company-predicting-ticket-priority-incident-volume-and-RFC

ISTM Project - ABC Tech Company
ABC Tech is an mid-size organization operation in IT-enabled business segment over a decade. On an average ABC Tech receives 22-25k IT incidents/tickets , which were handled to best practice ITIL framework with incident management , problem management, change management and configuration management processes. These ITIL practices attained matured process level and a recent audit confirmed that further improvement initiatives may not yield return of investment.

ABC Tech management is looking for ways to improve the incident management process as recent customer survey results shows that incident management is rated as poor.

ABC Tech management recently attended Machine Learning conference on ML for ITSM. Machine learning looks prospective to improve ITSM processes through prediction and automation. They came up with 4 key areas, where ML can help ITSM process in ABC Tech. 1. Predicting High Priority Tickets: To predict priority 1 & 2 tickets, so that they can take preventive measures or fix the problem before it surfaces. 2. Forecast the incident volume in different fields , quarterly and annual. So that they can be better prepared with resources and technology planning. 3. Auto tag the tickets with right priorities and right departments so that reassigning and related delay can be reduced. 4. Predict RFC (Request for change) and possible failure / misconfiguration of ITSM assets. Total of about 46k records from year 2012,2013,2014

Objectives

Predict High-Priority Tickets (P1 & P2): To prevent critical incidents by predicting them in advance.

Forecast Incident Volume: To help with resource and technology planning by predicting the number of incidents quarterly and annually.

Auto-Tagging Tickets: Automating the process of categorizing tickets correctly by priority and department to reduce delays.

Predict RFC and Possible Failures: Identifying possible failures or misconfigurations in ITSM assets related to requests for change (RFC).
